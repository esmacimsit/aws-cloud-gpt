# AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) â€” Well-Architected Framework Summary

The AWS Well-Architected Framework is based on **five pillars**, each representing a set of best practices for building secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient cloud workloads.

---

## 1. Operational Excellence
- Perform operations as code for repeatability and automation.
- Make frequent, small, reversible changes.
- Monitor systems and respond to events.
- Document and share knowledge for continuous improvement.
- Focus on business and operational priorities.

---

## 2. Security
- Apply the principle of least privilege with IAM.
- Enable traceability with logging and monitoring (CloudTrail, CloudWatch).
- Protect data at rest and in transit using encryption (KMS, SSL/TLS).
- Automate security best practices and patching.
- Prepare for security events with incident response plans.

---

## 3. Reliability
- Design systems to recover quickly from failures.
- Use multiple Availability Zones for high availability.
- Automatically scale resources to meet demand.
- Test recovery procedures regularly.
- Manage change using automation and version control.

---

## 4. Performance Efficiency
- Use the right instance types, storage, and databases for workload needs.
- Monitor performance metrics and adjust resources.
- Take advantage of serverless architectures (Lambda, API Gateway).
- Use caching and content delivery (CloudFront) for better performance.
- Experiment with new AWS services to improve efficiency.

---

## 5. Cost Optimization
- Implement cloud financial management practices.
- Use cost-effective resources (Spot, Savings Plans, Reserved Instances).
- Monitor and analyze spending with Cost Explorer and Budgets.
- Optimize resource usage (auto scaling, right-sizing).
- Reduce data transfer costs using CloudFront and edge locations.
